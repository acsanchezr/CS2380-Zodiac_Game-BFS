# Game using BFS Algorithm
This is a game developed in C++, where the user plays a character who has to go through 12 temples (Zodiac temples) to reach Athena's temple. The protagonist's reason to meet with Athena is so she can grant her/him a wish. Each temple is guarded by a warrior, and in order to defeat them and move on to the next temple, the protagonist must answer their questions.
While the mechanics of the game are simple, it makes use of a graph and a Breadth First Search algorithm to traverse it. A guess-my-number game is also implemented. 
The game was created as a final project for a Computer Science course.
